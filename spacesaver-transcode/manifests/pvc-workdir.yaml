# PVC placeholder for the encode working directory.
#
# PURPOSE:
#   The transcoder writes in-progress encode output to /workdir/<uuid>.mkv
#   before moving the file to /dest on success. This avoids partial files
#   ever appearing in the final library.
#
# STORAGE REQUIREMENTS:
#   - Must hold at least ONE full output file at a time (one encode runs at a time).
#   - For 4K (2160p) UHD content, a single output file can be up to ~80 GB.
#   - For 1080p TV content, budget ~20 GB per file.
#   - Fast local NVMe or SSD storage is strongly preferred to avoid the encode
#     being I/O-bound on the write side.
#   - NFS workdir will work, but may reduce encode throughput.
#
# HOW TO USE:
#   By default, the deployment uses an emptyDir volume for /workdir (ephemeral,
#   backed by the node's local disk). This is the simplest option for most
#   single-node clusters.
#
#   If you want to use a dedicated PVC instead (e.g., for a multi-node cluster
#   or to guarantee storage class placement):
#     1. Add this file to kustomization.yaml resources list.
#     2. In deployment.yaml, replace the emptyDir volume with a PVC reference:
#          persistentVolumeClaim:
#            claimName: spacesaver-workdir
#
# NOTE: This manifest is intentionally NOT in the default resources list.
# Do not apply it unless you intend to use a PVC for workdir.
