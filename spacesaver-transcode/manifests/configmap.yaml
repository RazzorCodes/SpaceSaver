# Default quality and operational settings for SpaceSaver.
# These values are injected as environment variables into the pod via envFrom.
# All settings can also be updated at runtime via POST /config/quality —
# the live change takes effect immediately without a pod restart.
#
# TV_CRF / MOVIE_CRF: libx265 Constant Rate Factor.
#   Lower = better quality, larger file. Range 0-51. Visually lossless ≈ 18-20.
# TV_RES_CAP / MOVIE_RES_CAP: Maximum output height in pixels (e.g. 1080 = 1080p).
#   Set to 0 to disable downscaling (encode at source resolution).
# RESCAN_INTERVAL: Seconds between source library scans. Default 600 = 10 minutes.
