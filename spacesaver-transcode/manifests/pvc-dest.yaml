# PVC for the transcoded output library, SQLite database, progress JSONs,
# and the .spacesaver-transcode flat tracking file.
#
# This volume is READ-WRITE for the transcoder pod.
# storageClassName: Set via kustomize overlay (kustomization.yaml → patches).
#
# Size: must be large enough to hold your entire finished library.
# A 1Ti source can grow slightly or shrink significantly after H.265 encoding.
# Size conservatively — at least equal to your current source library.
#
# ReadWriteMany (RWX) is required if you ever want to run multiple replicas
# (currently the deployment uses 1 replica, but RWX is set for future-proofing).
