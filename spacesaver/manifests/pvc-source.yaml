# storageClassName: Change this to match your cluster's storage backend.
#   Common values:
#     nfs           — NFS Provisioner
#     longhorn      — Longhorn
#     local-path    — Rancher local-path provisioner
#     manual        — for statically provisioned PVs
#
# ReadOnlyMany (ROX) is preferred so multiple pods can read the library
# concurrently. If your storage backend does not support ROX, use
# ReadWriteMany (RWX) and ensure the deployment mounts it read-only.
#
# Adjust storage size to match your actual source library size.
